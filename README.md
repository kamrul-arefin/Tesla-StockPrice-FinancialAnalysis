Line graph visualization of stock trends over time

- Scatter plot of daily closing prices

- 50-day Rolling Window (Moving Average) calculation

- Intro to rolling average concept used in financial analysis

- Probability estimation of significant drops (e.g., >10% in a day) using the normal distribution

- Multi-variable scatter matrix plot for feature relationships

# 🧠 Tools & Libraries Used
Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

Scipy.stats for probability calculation

NumPy for numerical operations
